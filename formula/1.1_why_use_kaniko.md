Kaniko is a powerful tool developed by Google for building container images from a Dockerfile. Here are some key reasons why you might want to use Kaniko:

1. **No Root Access Required**: Unlike traditional Docker builds that require root access, Kaniko can build images without needing any special privileges. This makes it ideal for environments where root access is restricted, such as Kubernetes clusters[1](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/introducing-kaniko-build-container-images-in-kubernetes-and-google-container-builder-even-without-root-access).

2. **Security**: Since Kaniko doesn't require a Docker daemon, it reduces the attack surface and potential security vulnerabilities associated with running a Docker daemon with elevated privileges[2](https://www.baeldung.com/ops/kaniko).

3. **Kubernetes Integration**: Kaniko is designed to run within a Kubernetes cluster, making it a seamless choice for cloud-native environments. It can be easily integrated with Kubernetes and Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)[1](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/introducing-kaniko-build-container-images-in-kubernetes-and-google-container-builder-even-without-root-access).

4. **Efficiency**: Kaniko builds images by executing commands in the Dockerfile and taking snapshots of the filesystem in user-space. This process is efficient and avoids the overhead of running a Docker daemon[2](https://www.baeldung.com/ops/kaniko).

5. **Flexibility**: You can use Kaniko in various environments, including Kubernetes clusters, Google Cloud Build, and even locally with tools like Minikube[2](https://www.baeldung.com/ops/kaniko).
